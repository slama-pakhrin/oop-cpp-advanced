I have done all the coding by myself and only
copied the code that my professor provided to 
complete my workshops and assignments.

****************************************************/

First of all, the workshop was very insightful and skill 
oriented what I mean by that is, it might come very handy
in real world scenrios.

What we were asked was pretty simple and part 2 was
not far from part 1, had to do minor changes but was 
confused for a bit. 
std::string desc;
This was what was asked and had to be done in part 2.

Well, one of the fundamental skill which is to receive 
arguments from the command line allowed the program to become
more adaptable or result oriented. The leaks that had to 
protected was also the part of this workshop, I'm talking 
about the memory leaks and how I didn't let it happen
which ofcoure one of the major part of this programming. 
Moreover, transforming the code where it accepts and manage
a user-defined string of any required length in this particular
task upgraded or polished my ability of understanding how 
dynamic memory allocation works along with data handling. 
One of the task was to access a variable which was defined 
in a different translation unit made me easy to work with 
data located in different parts of the program. Also,I had to 
apply header guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same
header file to avoid conflict. Also, static variables are the 
variables that has a lifespan till the program ends which is also 
used in function calls. 

Overall, this workshop has really helped me sharpen my skills
in C++ while presenting me the opportunity to learn and grow 
more as a programmer. I hope this comes very handy in the real
world programming task and makes me a better programmer.
